 ## Compiling
 If you want to get the lastest devoloper version right of the master branch, you can compile the code yourself. (make sure you have enough computer knowledge though)

### Requirements
**Python 3.7-3.8**

**All modules in requirements.txt (pip install -r requiremennts.txt)**

**Pyinstaller module (pip install pyinstaller)**

### Building the .exe
- CD to the folder you want to compile from in command prompt.
- Run the command "python3 -m PyInstaller -F --hiddenimport pkg_resources.py2_warn pygdrpc.py"
- Wait for it to finish then go in the newly created folder "dist", and your .exe should be waiting there.
